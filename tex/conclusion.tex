Duration of foraging trips was found to increase with the severity of incline traversed, with uphill foraging trips taking longer than downhill ones. It was also found that foraging paths that traverse severe inclines, both uphill and downhill, tend to be more direct, more stable, and more tightly constrained than foraging paths that traverse gentle inclines or no incline. These effects were observed in the corner-to-corner setup, where the direct path crosses the incline at an angle, and--to a lesser degree--in the center-to-center setup, where the direct path is aligned with the incline.
